## Server Cracked Checker

Ping the server using MCStatus or something similar, and pass the `response.raw['players']['sample']` to the API, the sample field is only present if there are people online. This program only works if there are people online on the server.

#### Features
- FastAPI powered API with autogenerated docs, just visit localhost/redoc after running.
- Completely asynchronous code, minimal dependencies.
- Mediocre Ratelimit Handling (If your request is ratelimited, the program will wait 0.5 seconds and retry the request)
- All checking steps documented (It's 3 am and I've used weird ways of getting things done, this is not clean code. If you want to use it inside of your project, rewrite part of it. I've detailed what I'm actually checking [here](https://github.com/TheOnlyWayUp/check_if_server_cracked/blob/main/main.py#L79-L105). The request function (get-uuid) is half decent though, that can be freely skidded.)
